                Design Thinking is a method created to solve complex and broad problems. It uses a <b>Empathize > Define > Ideate > Prototype > Test</b> cycle for generating and applying innovative ideas to the problems at hand, all the while keeping the specific challenges front and center.

                Senior Graduation Pitch

            <div class="event-description">
              In groups, we were assigned to come up with ideas for senior graduation traditions that we would set for many years to come. We practiced using the Design Thinking Method in two separate groups to create our presentations, and got ready to pitch our ideas to Sue at the end of the week.

              Amelia really spoke to me when she gave her presentation. She made a point right off the bat that the idea of only profit driven businesses is outdated, and would not work in the current <b>Ecosystem of Entrepreneurship</b>. She also spoke about the importance of failing first, finding what you need to improve, and trying again. To her, failure is the best indicator of success. Another opportunity that she told us to leverage was our “student card”. Essentially, tell people that you are a student when asking for help. People love helping students, so it’s a surefire way to get people to make time for you.

              The Value Proposition Canvas first needs to be broken down into the Customer Profile and the Value Map.

              Essentially, you want to research and find out your customer profile so you can fill their needs and wants with your product’s value map. It’s an excellent way to quickly summarize your entire product’s potential in one diagram, and seems to be something that I would use in the future

              Podcast Jigsaw #1
            </div>
            <div class="event-description">
              I really didn’t like this podcast. The host seems like he doesn’t understand how empathy works, and comes off as weirdly cold. He talks about how creating a monopoly is the best thing for your business. He makes sure to cover himself by saying that “oh, real monopolies are bad, don’t do those, just monopolize your <i>own</i> business,” but in reality, it sounds like he’s giving advice for how to monopolize your industry. I hope we don’t listen to more of this podcast.

                Week 1 Reflection
              </div>
              <div class="event-description">
                I feel this week has been a slow, but foundational start to this intensive. We started to develop and learn the Design Thinking methods, which we were able to apply to our Senior Graduation pitch later this week. Rashed Noman and Amelia were great speakers to have, and they both helped me understand more about entrepreneurship. They seemed to understand the true heart of entrepreneurship, the heart of innovation and solving real problems for the sake of solving them, rather then money. The podcast I felt we could have done without, as it seemed unemotional and only focused on the money aspect of entrepreneurship. I’m excited to see how the next few weeks will pan out!              </div>
