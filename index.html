              In groups, we were assigned to come up with ideas for senior graduation traditions that we would set for many years to come. We practiced using the Design Thinking Method in two separate groups to create our presentations, and got ready to pitch our ideas to Sue at the end of the week.

              Amelia really spoke to me when she gave her presentation. She made a point right off the bat that the idea of only profit driven businesses is outdated, and would not work in the current <b>Ecosystem of Entrepreneurship</b>. She also spoke about the importance of failing first, finding what you need to improve, and trying again. To her, failure is the best indicator of success. Another opportunity that she told us to leverage was our ‚Äústudent card‚Äù. Essentially, tell people that you are a student when asking for help. People love helping students, so it‚Äôs a surefire way to get people to make time for you.

              Essentially, you want to research and find out your customer profile so you can fill their needs and wants with your product‚Äôs value map. It‚Äôs an excellent way to quickly summarize your entire product‚Äôs potential in one diagram, and seems to be something that I would use in the future

            <div class="event-description">
              I really didn‚Äôt like this podcast. The host seems like he doesn‚Äôt understand how empathy works, and comes off as weirdly cold. He talks about how creating a monopoly is the best thing for your business. He makes sure to cover himself by saying that ‚Äúoh, real monopolies are bad, don‚Äôt do those, just monopolize your <i>own</i> business,‚Äù but in reality, it sounds like he‚Äôs giving advice for how to monopolize your industry. I hope we don‚Äôt listen to more of this podcast.

                Week 1 Reflection
              </div>
              <div class="event-description">
                I feel this week has been a slow, but foundational start to this intensive. We started to develop and learn the Design Thinking methods, which we were able to apply to our Senior Graduation pitch later this week. Rashed Noman and Amelia were great speakers to have, and they both helped me understand more about entrepreneurship. They seemed to understand the true heart of entrepreneurship, the heart of innovation and solving real problems for the sake of solving them, rather then money. The podcast I felt we could have done without, as it seemed unemotional and only focused on the money aspect of entrepreneurship. I‚Äôm excited to see how the next few weeks will pan out!              </div>

                Errol spoke mainly on innovation and the importance of ‚Äúthe heart of entrepreneurship.‚Äù Much like Amilia, he really spoke to me when talking about how ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù was an ugly word, as I feel that people can accomplish anything if given the right resources. He was the best speaker we‚Äôve had so far, and was truly a delight to listen to. He also seemed very interested in our individual success, even going as far as setting up a meeting with Ben in 21 days to check on some tasks he gave him. Overall, a great speaker who seemed to know his stuff.              </div>

              <div class="event-description">
                Duron mainly spoke about customer tribes, and the importance of knowing who your prospective customers are and who you can make into your prospective customers. This is a very important topic, and it can make or break your product. Having a good, positive customer tribe can be very beneficial to everyone, as there is a positive cycle of feedback and updates that improves the product. I learned a lot from him, and do want to use his advice in the future.

                Start on our BMC
              </div>

              <div class="event-description">
                I partnered with Farah, Dan, and Kuran to create a BMC (Business Model Canvas) for our company, WatchTower Notifications. WatchTower Notifications would focus on our premiere product, a extension for both Chrome and Firefox that combines all of your notifications into one simple area that you can easily manage. It‚Äôs honestly a very doable production, and I see myself developing something similar in the future. But anyways, we used a BMC to quickly outline our business model.

                <br>
                Using a BMC is actually quite easy: you just fill it out truthfully. Each category that you fill out is one step closer to conceptualizing your entire business on a single sheet of paper. It‚Äôs a really great way to organize your thoughts, and I will definitely use it again if the need arises.

              <div class="event-description">
                Sarah Studer was the first speaker that didn‚Äôt really lecture us. Instead, we took our BMC we had just made and presented it to her for feedback. Presenting for our first time was slightly nerve racking, but we got through the whole thing in the end. She gave use some good feedback, mainly areas where we could really tighten our wording and how we could improve our cost structure. We incorporated the feedback into our Business Plan, which we worked on next.

                Our Business Plan is the main document for our business, WatchTower Notifications. We started right off with sections II (Company Description) and III (Products and Services). This helped us to define a baseline for what our company would be before diving deeper into the organization structure and other various parts of the business. We were also able to really narrow down exactly what our product would be and how it would function. With all of this done, we then moved on to section IV (Marketing Plan). Our marketing plan is very basic, as there is not much competition in our space, and extensions are of the few things left that can still be spread by word of mouth. It mostly just consisted of Google AdSense and how that might work.

                Week two has been much better then week one, with a lot more things to do and a <b>lot</b> more speakers. I mean, out of the twelve 85 minute blocks this week, five of them were speakers. All I‚Äôm saying, maybe spread the speakers out a bit more next time. But overall, it‚Äôs been much better then week one. I‚Äôve felt that we‚Äôve made significant progress on our BMC and Business Plan, and I‚Äôm really feeling good about our company.

                We once again presented to a guest speaker. But before we presented this time, she gave us a bit of advice. She told us ‚ÄúEntrepreneurs usually run out of time, so prepare for that in advance.‚Äù Essentially, we needed to make sure that when we run out of time, we don‚Äôt just stumble through our last few words, but make them memorable and useful. Anyways, we got another round of feedback that helped to refine the product even further, and we incorporated it once again into our business plan.

              <div class="event-description">
                We needed to finish our business plan now, working on sections V (Operational Plan), VI (Management and Organization), VII (Startup Expenses and Capitalization), and VIII (Financial Plan). This was quite a lot of things to do, but breaking it up into smaller pieces that we each could focus individually on helped a lot. One thing that we had to figure out is competition. Simply put, we don‚Äôt have any. Therefore, we needed to strategize how to best use this to our advantage, as not many businesses have this opportunity. There‚Äôs not much else to say other then we smoothed out all the details of our business plan, and made sure that this could be something we could actually pitch to real investors. Link below:

                Our second to final activity was a quick in-class assessment, where we would listen to interviews with entrepreneurs. We then had to write ~8 sentences about how it related to concepts we had learned earlier in the past few weeks. It was a fun, quicker assignment that I finished a full 10 minutes before it was due. Gotta be honest, maybe extend the time just a bit. However, it was still a very cool assignment.

                Well, it‚Äôs all done. Three weeks of intensive work, countless speakers, and an entire business planned out. I‚Äôm honestly surprised how fast it all went by, an entire 3 weeks just on entrepreneurship doesn‚Äôt immediately strike you as the kind of thing that would be super enthralling. However, other then the podcast series, it actually was a super fun, engaging experience that I learned a lot from. I truly enjoyed the diverse array of speakers and activities that were provided to us, and I can‚Äôt wait to apply some of the skills I learned to real world scenarios.
